# Investigating-bias-in-evaluation-metrics-under-cross-validation-thesis-code
Repository contains the R-code used to produce the results in the thesis: Investigating bias in evaluation metrics under cross-validation

This GitHub contains three R-files, one text file and a README.

Textfile (SEEDS) contains the seeds used. They were autogenerated in R, but have been copied into the SEEDS-file. 

Files:
1) Benchmark and simulation
2) Loops and plots (main functions)
3) Playground

Files contain:
   1) Data set import and initial model. Function which creates the simulated data sets. Monte Carlo estimates
   2) Main function, which runs 1 CV and computes averaged and pooled metrics. Function with loops over seeds + plots. Function which loops over seeds and K + plots. Variance, bias and MSE plots
   3) Initial test of ROC packages. Sanity checks. Different summary tables
*NOTE* The names "dl" and "w" were often used as temporary names things that needed to be defined (unfortunately, their uses sometimes became semi permanent, e.g. plots). As a results the names dl and w appear a multitude of times.
